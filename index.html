        <p>I don't agree with Cathy stated that Japan is a good place for traveling. Because the scenery of the four seasons in Japan is very common in the world. We can see it in many place, such as Canada. In fact, Canada also has Sakura, Red Maple, and Snow. I think we no need to spend too much money to travel to Japan for it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On the other hand, Japan's consumption is very expensive. Canada is a big country of immigrants, so there also have many Japanese Food. We totally not necessary to travel to Japan for eating this foods. In fact, there was a major earthquake in Japan a few years ago, and the nuclear power plant exploded. Those nuclear wastes polluted the local environment and food. If you go to Japan, it will cause some bad effects to your health.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In short, Japan is not a good place to travel.</p>
